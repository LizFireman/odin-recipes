        <h3>Description</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Is it Thanksgiving without Pumpkin Pie? Personally pumpkin pie is my all time fav part of the meal. Unfortunately, my mom did not feel the same way. One year she made it without sugar (YUCK!). After this pie fail I took matters into my own hands. I had to learn how to make and later prefect my pumpkin pie recipe. After years of testing I have finally got the perfect recipe. It is thick, creamy, and full of flavor! </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Homemade Pie Dough</li>
        <li>One 15oz can Pumpkin Puree</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/3 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>

        <li>1/4 cup 1% milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Make the pumpkin pie filling:</em> Whisk the pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, heavy cream, and milk. Vigorously whisk until everything is combined.</li>
        <li>Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm crust. Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up.</li>
        <li><em>Bake:</em> Bake the pie until the center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take.After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown.</li>
        <li>Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours before garnishing and serving.</li>
        <li>Decorate with sugared cranberries and pie crust leaves</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Left overs last about 5 days so feel free to have some pie for breakfast the next morning!</p>
