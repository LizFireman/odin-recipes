Intro HTML First Website
This is a recipe website. This is the first project I am doing as part of the Odin Foundational class. I have learned how to create a new github and git repository. Commit code and messages to git and then push them to github. Create a simple website with different headings, paragraphs, types of fonts, links and images.
